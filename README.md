# Assalamu Alaikum, I'm [Botir Khaltaev] ðŸ‘‹

Driven by the teachings of my faith, I find profound wisdom in the words:

> "The strong man is not the one who can overpower others. Instead, the strong man is the one who controls himself when he is angry." - Prophet Muhammad ï·º [Sahih al-Bukhari]

In the intricate world of software development, this Hadith reminds me that strength isn't merely about technical prowess. It's about exhibiting patience during tough debugging sessions, showing kindness during code reviews, and maintaining a spirit of collaboration even amidst differing opinions.

## My Core Principles

- **Genuine Strength & Patience**: I believe that true strength lies not in dominance but in mastering our own reactions. This is a guiding principle in every code I write, every team interaction, and every project I undertake.
- **Integrity & Respect**: I believe that in everything you do in life, you must fear God, treat everyone with respect and act with integrity because as a Muslim, I am a representative of our beloved Prophet Muhammad ï·º
